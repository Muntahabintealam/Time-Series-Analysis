This repository contains my project work for a time series analysis assignment. The primary focus of the project was to develop a robust forecasting model using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) method. The analysis was performed using R, and the dataset involved a univariate time series data.
Key aspects of the project:

Preliminary data analysis to understand the underlying patterns and structures.
Model selection and diagnostics, emphasizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and residual checks for autocorrelation and normality.
Selection of the best-fitting ARIMA model based on the principle of parsimony and diagnostic tests, including the Ljung-Box test and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality.
Forecasting future values with confidence intervals to provide insights into expected trends and the reliability of the predictions.
The repository includes:

The pdf for the instructions of the project
R scripts for the analysis and model building.
A detailed report summarizing the methodology, results, and conclusions.
This project was completed as part of Data.Stat.780,Tampere University,
